This is the code for two basic Natural Language Processing operations.
1. Entity Extraction
2. Keyterm Extraction

The entity extractor has been built on top of NLTK, the NLP toolkit in Python.
It requires the user to have NLTK installed and the NLTK data as well.

The keyterm extractor has been built on top of topia term extractor in Python.

Usage:
 - The entityExtractor.py reads text from a .txt file and performs the operation of entity extraction and returns a list of entities.
 - The keywordExtractor.py reads text from a .txt file and performs the operation of keyterm extraction and returns a list of keyterms.
